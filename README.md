## üìñ About nyanBOX

nyanBOX is a fork of the original nRFBOX project by CiferTech, now maintained by jbohack & zr_crackiin. This version includes various improvements and new features while maintaining compatibility with the original hardware.

### üÜï What's New
- Updated UI with improved display layout
- Enhanced stability and performance
- New features and improvements to existing functionality
- Active maintenance and support

## :star2: Project Overview

nyanBOX is a wireless toolkit designed to explore, analyze, and interact with various wireless communication protocols. Based on the original nRFBOX by CiferTech, this fork retains all the powerful features while introducing new improvements and providing ongoing maintenance.

The device combines the ESP32 Wroom32U, NRF24 modules, an OLED display, and other components to create a multifunctional device that can act as a scanner, analyzer, jammer, BLE jammer, BLE spoofer, and perform advanced tasks such as the "Sour Apple" attack.
