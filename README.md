- When using **multiple NRF24** modules, the power demands can exceed the capabilities of the onboard power supply or regulator. Running three NRF modules simultaneously may cause instability, leading to intermittent failures or causing the nyanBOX to stop functioning altogether.
- **Range Limitations**: The jammer is most effective at short range. Beyond a certain distance, the signal weakens, making it harder to consistently disrupt communication.
- **Device Variability**: Different devices react to jamming signals in varying ways. Some may be more resistant.

<!-- About the Project -->
## :star2: About the Project
nyanBOX is a wireless toolkit designed to explore, analyze, and interact with various wireless communication protocols. Based on the original nRFBOX by CiferTech, this fork maintains all the powerful features while adding new improvements and active maintenance. The device combines the ESP32 Wroom32U, NRF24 modules, an OLED display, and other components to create a multifunctional device that can act as a scanner, analyzer, jammer, BLE jammer, BLE spoofer, and perform advanced tasks such as the "Sour Apple" attack.

## ðŸ”— Prerequisites

### USB Drivers
- Install the required USB drivers for your ESP32 board:
  - For CP210x-based boards: [CP210x USB to UART Bridge VCP Drivers](https://www.silabs.com/developers/usb-to-uart-bridge-vcp-drivers)
  - For CH340/CH341-based boards: [CH340 Drivers](https://www.wch.cn/download/CH341SER_EXE.html)

&nbsp;
## ðŸš€ Development with PlatformIO in VS Code

For the best development experience, we recommend using PlatformIO in Visual Studio Code:

### Prerequisites
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [PlatformIO IDE](https://platformio.org/install/ide?install=vscode) extension

### Getting Started
1. Clone this repository
2. Open the project in VS Code:
   - Select `File > Open Folder`
   - Choose the nyanBOX directory

### Configuration
- The project is pre-configured for ESP32-DevKitC in `platformio.ini`
- For other ESP32 boards, update the `board` parameter in `platformio.ini`

### Building and Uploading
1. Build the project: Click the checkmark icon in the blue status bar
2. Connect your ESP32 via USB
3. Upload the firmware: Click the right-arrow icon
4. Monitor output: Click the plug icon to open the serial monitor

### Troubleshooting
- If upload fails, try holding the BOOT button during upload
- Verify the correct COM port is selected in the status bar
- Ensure proper USB drivers are installed (see Prerequisites)
